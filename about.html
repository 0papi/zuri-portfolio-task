    <h2>Just A Wee Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Once again, my name is Evans Alex Kwofie. I am currently a member of the
      Ziru training program, cohort22, where I am learning backend development
      part time. I am also a part-time teacher and a full time coder. My goal is
      to learn enough to land a tech role and then start teaching everything I
      know to my young uns.
